# project-management-test

Basic workflow to see how moving solely to Github would work.

## Issues
Templates for new features and bugs have been made to make everything more consistent. More templates could be made for other types of work, for example documentation, adding unit tests, refactoring code etc.
To view these try creating a new issue.

Labels will help bring more visibility at a glance and provide better sorting/filtering.

Issues can be found here https://github.com/jayEvans89/project-management-test/issues.

## Sprints
A project board can be used for a sprint. This allows everyone to see exactly where everything is at any point in time. The progress bar at the top also gives an indication as to how the sprint is going. Any remaining issues at the end of the sprint will be moved to the next sprint.
Project boards can be found here https://github.com/jayEvans89/project-management-test/projects

### Board Automation
#### To do
All newly created issues will that are added to the board will start here.

#### In progress
Developer moves the issue to here when they start work on it

#### Pull Requests
Any created pull requests will be moved here automatically.

#### For Testing
Once a PR has been merged, any issues that it closes will be moved here. This will let testing know that they are ready for QnA.

#### Done
Closed PR's will be moved to here.
Once an issue has been tested and QnA are heppy with it, the issue is moved to here

## Stories
A milestone can be used to break down large issues into smaller ones. This gives all the relevant issues a central place to keep designs, documents etc.
It also gives the ability to see how far along the feature is.

Milestones can also be used for large groups of issues, for example bugs. This will help everyone visualise where we are at with them, and hopefully stop things being forgotten/missed.
